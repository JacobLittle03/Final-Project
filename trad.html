                <p>Greetings! My name is Jacob Little. I currently attend Elmhurst University and aim to complete digital media as my major so I can explore
                the world of digital media and what it has to offer career-wise! This portfolio is a display of my evolution
                in terms of my artwork/displaying the skill-set I have, that mainly revolving around digital work,
                but there is traditional work as well to be accounted for. I have been drawing since 2014 and
                doing digital work since 2016, and while this is more recent work, it is an improvement from where
                I first started. Have a great day and hopefully you enjoy what you see!</p>
